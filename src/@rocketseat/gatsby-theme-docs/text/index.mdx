# Purpose

I want to become completely familiar with the fundamentals of being a System Architect. I need to direct my learning to the areas that I will get the most from. It will be easy to become distracted by less important details as it's such a broad field. Details are important but as I'm so fresh to it, I need to get the fundamental knowledge in place. Sort of like what I did with SOLID principles / TDD etc over the course of a few years when I was in my late 20's.
